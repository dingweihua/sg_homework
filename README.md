This is a homework from Doctor Chen on 2015/06.
It receives the code from url and then right-shift each letter with 3 units.
e.g. the source code is 'abcde', the decrypted code would be 'defgh'. That is 'a' to 'd', 'e' to 'h' and so on.
If the code has already been decrypted, we'll display the info with the decryption datetime.
